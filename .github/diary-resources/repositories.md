# Repositories

The following table shows relevant repositories that will be often talked about.
You must always reference the repository by the full name (i.e. org/repo), and only use the alias as a guide when the user uses it to know which repo they are mentioning. The description can be used when the user asks for guidelines on where to make a change.

| Repository | Alias | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| <org/repo> | My repo | The main respository |
